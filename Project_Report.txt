Travel Planner AI Agent — LangGraph Submission

Overview :

This project is a simple AI-based travel planner that runs entirely offline. You just type in your travel request (like “Plan a 3-day trip to Udaipur”) and it generates a full itinerary using a local AI model.

It uses:
- LangGraph to manage the flow
- FAISS for vector search
- HuggingFace's `flan-t5-small` model for generating the travel plan

Everything runs locally — no internet or API keys needed.

---

How It Works:

Step 1: Search Destinations
The app takes your input and finds the most relevant destinations using semantic search (FAISS).

Step 2: Generate Itinerary
It then passes the result to a local language model which generates a 3-day travel plan.

---

Tools Used:

- LangGraph: to manage the AI workflow
- FAISS: to find similar destinations based on user query
- flan-t5-small: a lightweight language model that runs on CPU
- Streamlit: for an easy-to-use web interface
- HuggingFace Transformers: for embedding and text generation

---

Data and RAG Logic:

- The app loads a list of destinations from `destinations.csv`
- It embeds their descriptions using a sentence-transformer model
- On user input, the app retrieves top 5 matches
- Then it generates a 3-day plan based on the results

If no matches are found, it still generates a generic itinerary.

---

How to Run:

There are two options:

Option A (Terminal):
Run `python main.py` and enter your travel request.

Option B (Web App):
Run `streamlit run app.py` to use the web interface.

All setup steps are explained in the file `RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`.

   Final Notes:

- This project works fully offline
- Runs on any modern PC
- No external API or paid services required
- The code is clean, commented, and easy to follow
